# BIOMD0000000057: Sneyd2002_dynamic_model_of_IP3_Receptor

## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000057.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000057.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000057 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes


This model was successfully tested on Jarnac and MathSBML. The model
reproduces the time profile of "Open Probability" of the receptor as shown in
Figure 4 of the publication. The value of calcium ion concentration "c" in
this model is 10 microM.
